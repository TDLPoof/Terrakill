Terrakill is a content and game-tweak mod that adds movement options, health mechanics, and weapon selection from ULTRAKILL into Terraria.
The mod does not add enemies and probably won't for a while bc i suck at making NPCs, sorry :/

[c/8bac0f:DO THIS:]
 - Switch your life indicator to Bar mode (it works nicely with the Hard Damage text and Stamina Bar)
 - Assign all your keybinds! Please don't play without assigning at least your Alt Fire keybind.

Mechanic additions and changes:
 - Life crystals and stuff are now useless. You are capped to 100 max life.
 - Regeneration no longer exists. No using pickup hearts, potions, or anything else to regain life.
 - A stamina bar with three charges allows you to Dash (LShift) and Slide (V).

Weapons are acquired by slaying bosses. Progression is as follows:

Piercer Revolver: On spawn
Feedbacker: On spawn
Any Revolver variant: Drops from King Slime
Any Shotgun variant: Drops from Eye of Cthulhu
Any Nailgun variant: Drops from Skeletron
Any Rocket Launcher variant: Drops from Queen Bee
Any Railcannon variant: Drops from Wall of Flesh
Knuckleblaster: Drops from Wall of Flesh
Whiplash: Drops from Plantera

A new weapon, the rifle, as a drop from Deerclops. Additionally, red variants for weapons that do not have one (or gold variants for those that do) have been added. They can be crafted with Experimental Circuitry, a drop from Mechanical Bosses.
